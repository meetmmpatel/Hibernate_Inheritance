MappedSuperclass -
Inheritance is implemented in the domain model only without reflecting
it in the database schema. In this strategy, the parent classes canâ€™t be entities.


Single table - The domain model class hierarchy is materialized
into a single table which contains entities belonging to different class types.


Joined table - The base class and all the subclasses have their own database
tables and fetching a subclass entity requires a join with the parent table as well.


Table per class - Each subclass has its own table containing both the subclass
and the base class properties.
